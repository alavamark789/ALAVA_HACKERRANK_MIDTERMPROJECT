I created the `kangaroo` function by first checking if the two kangaroos have the same speed; if so, they only meet if they start at the same position. Otherwise, I checked if the difference in starting positions is evenly divisible by the difference in speeds and that the result is non-negative, which means they land at the same spot at the same time. If both conditions are met, they meet otherwise, they donâ€™t.
